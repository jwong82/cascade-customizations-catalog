# Cascade Customizations Catalog

A community-driven repository of sample rules and workflows for Windsurf Cascade. Cascade Customizations (Rules and Workflows) guide the AI's behavior to make the tool more effective for varying use cases, frameworks, and development practices.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized hub for the Windsurf community to share, discover, and contribute reference customizations that enhance Cascade. 

This catalog is intended to serve as:
1. A central location for the Windsurf community to aggregate sample rules and workflows
2. A reference repository structure that Enterprises can use to catalog and distribute proprietary and internal Cascade Customizations

## What are Customizations?

Customizations in Cascade drive Cascade's behavior and fall under the categories of Rules or Workflows:

### Rules
Rules influence how Cascade responds to user prompts. Because not all rules should apply to every user prompt, there are four types of rule activation modes:

- **Always On**: Rules that apply to every user message
- **Model Decision**: Rules that Cascade chooses to apply based on the rule's description
- **Glob-based**: Rules that Cascade applies based on file patterns (such as `*.js`, `dir/*, dir/**/*.js`)
- **Manual**: Rules that users tell Cascade to apply as desired

These rules apply guidelines for the AI to follow during response generation.

### Workflows
Workflows are explicitly defined step-by-step procedures that help Cascade work through sequential tasks. Workflows are available via the /\<workflow-name> shortcut in the Text Box.

Workflows can be used for one time tasks like project setup or repeated tasks like testing procedures, deployment processes, debugging methodology, and more.

## Browse the Catalog

### 🌐 Web Interface
**[Browse the Catalog Online](https://windsurf-samples.github.io/cascade-customizations-catalog/web-ui/index.html)**

Use our interactive web interface to easily browse, search, and discover customizations. The web catalog provides:

- **Search and Filter**: Find customizations by name, category, or keywords
- **Live Preview**: View rule and workflow content directly in the browser
- **Easy Copy**: One-click copying of customization files
- **Category Navigation**: Browse by framework, language, or use case
- **Documentation Links**: Direct access to detailed documentation

### 🔍 Semantic Search
**[Ask Questions with DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/Windsurf-Samples/cascade-customizations-catalog)**

Use natural language to semantically search through all rules and workflows. Ask questions like:
- "Help me write a rule for TypeScript best practices"
- "What workflows are available that help with deployment to Kubernetes?"
- "Show me security-focused rules for React projects"
- "Find testing workflows for Node.js applications"

DeepWiki provides intelligent, context-aware answers by understanding the content and relationships within the catalog.

## Getting Started

1. **Browse Online**: Visit the [web catalog](https://windsurf-samples.github.io/cascade-customizations-catalog/web-ui/index.html) to explore available customizations
